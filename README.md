## easyCheckout

EasyCheckout allows small businesses to carry out online transactions and reduce the number of customers present in the store. Itâ€™s customizable on many levels. The backend was built using Python Flask with MySQL to store information about each order. This included the items, the order number, total price and other order related values. This can be altered depending on the consumers needs. The front end was developed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create an easy/usable interface for all ages.
